# Omnifood

Omnifood is a fictional private company for providing free delievery healthy food. 

Currently, most people don't have enough time to cook on their own. Even though we can prepare our meals by purchasing them from restaurants or stores, 
we hardly know what the ingredients are in these products and how the dishes are cooked. Moreover, we can't obtain the required nutritions per day and maintain balanced diet.
Here, Omnifood can provide what you earger to look for. We have 100% organic foods and different meal plans. All the services are free delevery. Let's check it out today.
